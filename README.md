MariaDB is used because it is fast, scalable and robust, with a rich ecosystem of storage engines, plugins and many other tools make it very versatile for a wide variety of use cases.

MariaDB is developed as open source software and as a relational database it provides an SQL interface for accessing data. The latest versions of MariaDB also include GIS and JSON features.

### Volume structure

- `/var/lib/mysql/mysql-bin`: MariaDB logs

### Environment Variables:

#### Main Mariadb parameters:

- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: specify the name of the database
- `MYSQL_USER`: specify the User for the database
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: specify the User password for the database
- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: specify the root password for Mariadb

### Creating an instance

```bash
docker run -it --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -v /var/lib/mysql:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpressdb -e MYSQL_USER=wordpressuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=oJudbf84J7rI95jUh3 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ik78ksejIsdfqh2Jhd blueline/alpine-mariadb

```

It will create a new db, and set mysql root password (default is RaNd0MpA$$W0Rd generated by pwgen) unless the data already exists.
